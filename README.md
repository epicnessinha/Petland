# Petland

Geekshub Bootcamp Final project where we're challanged to create a  web-application capable of interacting with a backend through a JSON API.
Petland is a web app where the users can adopt abandoned animals that are currently living in shelters (the pets data used is actually real and last updated in DATE).
The user is able to visualize all the animals available for adoption in the moment, as well search for a specific one (dog, cat. breed, age...)
In order to adopt an animal, the user must be register, once the login is done successfully, the user needs to fill a form with several questions that after submited will be review for approval by the administrator.
The user can edit his/her profile as well, change the profile picture, email, address and other personal data.
The admin is able to see all the users registered, to add and delete the adoption announcements and approve or refuse the adoption requests made by the users.
In the footer of the page you can find the direct links to the real shelters where you can adopt an animal or support the institution.

## About App:


### Needs updates
In order to develop this project, for the frontend part we used React with React-Router-Dom, Axios, functional components, debounced search, validated forms, useContext, and also, correct folder distribution with the use of services for external API calls.
<br>
Users are able to consult and filter data (all search inputs are debounced), submit adoption requests through a form, validated (error check).
<br>
I implemented pagination for displayed elements coming from the API and a light/dark theme selector with the use of React useContenxt as a global state manager.
