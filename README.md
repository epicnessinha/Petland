### Needs updates
In order to develop this project, for the frontend part we used React with React-Router-Dom, Axios, functional components, debounced search, validated forms, useContext, and also, correct folder distribution with the use of services for external API calls.
<br>
Users are able to consult and filter data (all search inputs are debounced), submit adoption requests through a form, validated (error check).
<br>
I implemented pagination for displayed elements coming from the API and a light/dark theme selector with the use of React useContenxt as a global state manager.
